# AArch64 Virtual Private Server 


We have been fortunate enough to receive a large donation of 50+ Arm64 (v8) eMAG 32core machines from Ampere Computing. This hardware is now live, and we are accepting applications via our [application form](https://fosshost.org/apply). 

Initially, the first batch of Arm-based hardware will be for virtualization purposes, rather than “full dedicated” access to the hardware. However, once our second batch becomes available, we will consider how we can provide dedicated provisioning. We intend to release the second batch within the US, and further details will be communicated once available. 

## What to do after getting approved for the AArch64 VPS?

After you get a confirmation email from our support, you should make sure to register for an account at [console.aarch64.com](https://console.aarch64.com) (the Console).

Our team will create a project in the Console and assign it to the account you created previously.

The number of cores you were approved with is called “a budget” that you can use to create an instance(s) according to your needs. You are not required to use all of them for a single instance; you can create multiple instances in which vCPUs are not exceeding the budget.
