We love to hear from individuals, groups, or organizations who wish to volunteer, contribute or donate to the Fosshost project.

You can reach out to our volunteering team by [contacting us](https://fosshost.org/contact) with a covering letter and CV to tell us why you think you would be a good fit!

Full training is offered to all volunteers, and you are automatically eligible for any Fosshost services as our way of saying thank you.

## Learning and Education[¶](http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/volunteering-opportunities/#learning-and-education)

By volunteering, you will have the opportunity to provide and support world-class hosting facilities for many open source projects and good causes. From system administration, build requests, and providing community support, we need your help. We operate mixed architecture, and some projects are shifting upwards of 20TB per month. You will have the autonomy to make a real difference and impact and receive mentoring to provide critical support to some of the most important open-source projects. 

Our volunteering program is beneficial for students and apprentices wanting to learn Linux, virtualization, and the responsibilities of managing a large and global infrastructure. Many students are already benefiting from the skills and hands-on experience, and we pride ourselves on using bleeding-edge technology to offer projects with a stable hosting experience, which can allow them to grow.

## Available Volunteering Opportunities[¶](http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/volunteering-opportunities/#available-volunteering-opportunities)

Most of our volunteer opportunities are the ones you would expect from running a global infrastructure: coding, systems administration, support, and network engineering. This is, however, only part of what our volunteering team does. We also welcome marketing, writing, community management, systems security, and any other skills you have that can be of use for us to grow.

No matter your talents, please [contact us](https://fosshost.org/contact) if you feel you can help us evolve and support the Free and Open-Source Software ecosystem and want to contribute to this fantastic community.
