# Getting Started
Fosshost provides several free cloud computing / hosting services to the free and open-source software community. These services are delivered virtually through our infrastructure and are available singularly or in multiple combinations for [eligible](/general/application) projects. 

## Production Services
Production services are services that we allow you to apply for via our [application form](https://fosshost.org/apply). In other words, they have been tested and verified to be suitable for live and production use. These are:

- x86 Virtual Private Server;
- AArch64 Virtual Private Server;
- Domain Name Services / DNS;
- Mirrors-as-a-Service (available for package mirrors, operating systems, repositories, documentation, static assets, etc);

You can browse on the left-hand navigation bar through each of the above services in more detail.
