# Cloud Regions
The Fosshost and AArch64 infrastructure operates from multiple regions. These locations have been chosen because of their geographical location and to ensure that our services remain accessible to a global audience. They are:

- UK
- USA
- Canada
- Netherlands

Depending on availability, current capacity we may not show all regions during the application process.  Please keep checking the application form for when new regions become available.  We are always adding new regions and releasing new capacity.
